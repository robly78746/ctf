## Description

50 points

Grace was trying to make some food for her family but she really messed it up. She was trying to make some hashbrowns but instead, she made this:

I guess Grace is a really bad cook. But at least she tried to add some md5 sauce.

remember to put the flag in nactf{....}

Hint: Theres always a cracker for everything

## Approach

From the description, we can guess this is an md5 hash, and we can google for an md5 hash reverse lookup like https://md5hashing.net/hash/md5

## Solution

The reverse lookup results in grak, so the flag is nactf{grak}
